mixed_pop: False #True means you have 5 channels, in the order: protein, red nuclei, green nuclei, actin, total nuclei. False means you have 3 channels: golgi, red/green nuclei, actin
gamma_cell: 0.9 # CELLS Gamma Correction in case case there is no signal homogeneity between different cells in the FOV. Suggested value between 0.4 and 1.0 (no correction)
gaussian_cell: 0 #CELL Gaussian Blur to make the signal more homogeneous within single cells. 0 means no blur. Suggested value between 0 and 10.
gamma_nu: 0.9 # NUCLEI
gaussian_nu: 1.0 # NUCLEI
filter_area_cell: 6000 # Cell area threshold (in pixels) - Remove all objects that have an area smaller than the Area threshold.
filter_area_nu: 3000 # Nuclear area threshold (in pixels) - Remove all objects that have an area smaller than the Area threshold.
filter_ecc: 1.00 # Eccentricity threshold - Remove all objects that have an eccentricity higher than the eccentricity threshold. Note that the circle has eccentricity 0, while an ellipse has eccentricity between 0 and 1. This value goes close to 1 when you increase the ratio major/minor axis of the ellipse.
